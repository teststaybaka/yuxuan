    Hello there, I'm Yuxna Xie or Alan. Welcome!
</p>
<p>
    I'm a student graduated from Tsinghua University and now studying at Columbia University in the City of New York, pursuing master degree.  Majored in computer science, I've learned and coded a lot. Most of my experiences are recorde in <a href="{{ uri_for('experiences') }}" class="blue-link">my journey</a>. I'm looking for a job now or maybe trying to start my own business?
</p>
<p>
   During these studying days, my mind is filled with a lot of ideas. In the old days, I thought any of them requires a large team and I had to wait until I was able to put together some people. But now, I believe that even by myself I am able to complete them! You can find some of them in <a href="{{ uri_for('ideas') }}" class="blue-link">my ideas</a>.
</p>
<p>
    One of my ideas is a danmaku video website, which makes it different from the other video sites is <i><b>Danmaku</b></i>. Here, <i>danmaku</i> means comments, but instead of leaving them below the video, those comments are flying across the screen while playing.
</p>
<p>
    The website is on building now.<a class="catch-button" target="_blank" href="https://dan-tube.appspot.com">Go to it â†’ dan-tube.appspot.com</a>
</p>
<p>
    Another one is to make an action game. It's a warm-up project to let me learn some game developing techniques. Although a one-man team is hardly promising, I don't want to give up now.
