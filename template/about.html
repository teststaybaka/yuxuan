<p>
    Hello there, I'm Yuxna Xie or Alan. Welcome to my website. <!-- You won't feel boring here. -->
</p>
<p>
    First let me introduce myself. I'm a student graduated from Tsinghua University and now studying at Columbia University in the City of New York, pursuing master degree.  Majored in computer science, I've learned and coded a lot.
</p>
<p>
   During these studying days, my mind is being filled with tons of ideas. Even though I know little about some of them, I won't stop my pace.
</p>
<p>
    The very first idea is a danmaku video website, which makes it different from the other video sites is <i><b>Danmaku</b></i>. Here, <i>danmaku</i> means comments, but instead of leaving them below the video, those comments are flying across the screen while playing. You may think they will distract you from enjoying the video. I had the same thoughts as you before, but after several tries, I'm incredible attracted by this new type of video watching.
</p>
<p>
    The website is on building now.<a class="catch-button" href="https://dan-tube.appspot.com">Go to it â†’ dan-tube.appspot.com</a>
</p>
<p>
    Another idea is to make an action game. Well, it's not really the case. This game project is just a warnup for the following project that I'm so exciting about.
